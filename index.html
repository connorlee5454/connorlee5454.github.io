    <h1>All About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey there! My name is Connor Lee.</p>
    <p>I am an 8th grade student currently attending Charles DeWolf Middle School in Old Tappan, New Jersey as of 2020.</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rowing</li>
      <li>Video Games</li>
      <li>Coding</li>
    </ul>
    <div id="Coding Experience"></div>
    <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
    <p>I am passionate with coding, and I am in the process of learning certain programming languages such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>Python</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To learn, I use a site called CodeCademy, which has many courses that teach people the basics of programming.</p>
    <p>I am also currently taking a Python class in Closter, once a week. </p>
    <p>In the future, I would like to use my coding experience along with my math experience to create programs that help people with problems related to mathematics.</p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>One of my projects is a four-function calculator, made with HTML and CSS.</p>
    <a href="file:///C:/Users/conno/Documents/Coding%20Stuff/connorlee541.github.io/game.html">HTML Calculator</a>
    <p>Using Python, I created another calculator that can calculate the volume of certain shapes along with the four functions, on repl.it.</p>
    <a href="https://Shape-Calculator.bloodkick.repl.run">Python Calculator</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>All in all, I want to use my programming skills for the social good, and help people with their daily lives.</h4>
